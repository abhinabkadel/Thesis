1. STAT 545 A+B
    Introduction to Data Analysis using R
    Emphasis in learning concepts of R that assist Data Analysis
    good for beginners with limited idea on what data analysis is
    Rating: Excellent
        - instructor is well versed, the assignments are manageable and hands on. 
        - 3 TAs who are available to answer general questions related to R / data analysis  
    Downsides:
        - if you are looking to improve statistical basis for data analysis, this is not the right course

2. ATSC 507: NWP
    Numerical Weather Prediction

    Rating: Excellent
        - definitely recommend as it is very relevant to our team's work
        - Combination of programming, WRF runs and mathematic derivation excercise
        - learn about scientific foundation behind NWP models

3. EOSC 511: Numerical techniques
    implicit and explicit methods to solve partial differential equations

    Rating: Poor
        - Personally found the course to be messy and stressful
        - No feedback to the assignments submitted
        - might be relevant to someone who plans to work on building a new model
        - (only) Good point: helps improve your python knowledge
    
4. CEEN 525: Energy Policy
    Renewable Energy policy. Starts with framework on how policy construction takes place.
    Then moves to policy instruments relevant to renewable energy, and assessing policy effectiveness

    Rating: Good
        - Recommend for people planning on pursuing a career in renewable energy
        - final project consisted of a policy analysis, providing you with a flexibility to choose
            an renewable energy related policy to critique on.

    Downsides:
        - only 2 CP. I need to take one more course because of this one. 
        - Get ready to read a lot   
    
5. ECON 471: Economics of Non-Renewable Resources
    I took the course as a primer to economic concepts. This was my first introduction to R 
    before taking the STAT 545 course. So, it was useful. 

    Rating: Good
        - If you want to learn economics but not take the entire 4 year degree, this might
            be the course 
    
    Downsides:
        - Graded through tests. 
        - Undergraduate level course

6. ATSC 448A: directed studies
    Research proposal + ATSC 201
    ATSC 201 is a good course to learn fundamentals of meteorology with some math and learning
    about radars and weather charts
